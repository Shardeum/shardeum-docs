# Important Notice for DApp Devs

Performance/network updates are common during testnets but we want you to be aware that the Shardeum Liberty network might be reset at least for some of these updates and releases. We will try to preserve the network state, but there is a chance it does not work and we may need to do a full network relaunch. Of course, we will do our best to give notice before such resets.

In the case of a full relaunch, accounts will be reset in which case you can use your judgment to pull data from your DApps on Liberty. If there is a reset, you will need to use the faucet again, and redeploy smart contracts. We expect that there will be several full data resets throughout Shardeum Liberty. Thanks for understanding and we appreciate your support.
